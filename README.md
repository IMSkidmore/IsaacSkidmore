11/30 SWITCHING TO REACT

11/30 PSYCH NOT SWITCHING TO REACT, changed the vision, now planning on keeping retro style and doing terminal based design with unique commands that user can input to see different information.

Implement Ascii animation using ascii converter from pictures, and then display images in sequence with slight fade in between for smoothness, provide captions underneath using the type and untype animation. Envisioning an animation of my face waving welcoming user before fading to black and then typing like its a terminal providing the user with the chance to input their own text and responding based on their command.

Stick with retro style, envisioning a very simple full screen single screen application, immersive. have commands like "education" "more about me" "projects" "career" and others to bring up information, and try to include some easter eggs or nerdy references. Could have secret binary or hex codes.
