11/30 SWITCHING TO REACT

11/30 PSYCH NOT SWITCHING TO REACT, changed the vision, now planning on keeping retro style and doing terminal based design with unique commands that user can input to see different information.

Implement Ascii animation using ascii converter from pictures, and then display images in sequence with slight fade in between for smoothness, provide captions underneath using the type and untype animation. Envisioning an animation of my face waving welcoming user before fading to black and then typing like its a terminal providing the user with the chance to input their own text and responding based on their command.

Stick with retro style, envisioning a very simple full screen single screen application, immersive. have commands like "education" "more about me" "projects" "career" and others to bring up information, and try to include some easter eggs or nerdy references. Could have secret binary or hex codes.

implementing code for ascii animation using javascript

implement google gemini api and give it a lot of information about me, then let it answer whatever question the user visiting the website could ask.

Scrap the command style interface.. have ascii animation on startup, then show different options as links around centered ascii animation with titles such as "education" "ask me anything (using google gemini api)", "projects", etc, and have animation point at the option the user is hovering. On each tab show information, and highlight a number somewhere on that tab, then have one of the tabs be a secret password that the user can enter the numbers they've found for a a secret ascii animation or something cool.

gemini seems unnecessary for this small of a project. It was fun to go through and learn but its time to pivot. Want to use bard and chatgpt while building to get as comfortable as possible with prompting. 

different ideas for pivot are still doing command style, or doing discord style with channels with information, information could look like message from me.

work too busy, can't focus on this. want to get back to it

new idea, text based adventures, beat little enemies with spells to unlock different information as reusme, allow user to skip game and just get info. try to keep pretty short, <5 mins
