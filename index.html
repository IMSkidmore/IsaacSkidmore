    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm a passionate web developer based in [Your Location]. I graduated from Arizona State University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. Currently, I work at Zenith Semiconductor, where I wear multiple hats, primarily focusing on IT and layout engineering. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my wife and our lovely cat. I have a deep love for reading, music, and nature. Problem-solving, both mentally and physically, is a challenge I embrace. I'm a regular gym-goer and firmly believe in the importance of kindness in all aspects of life.</p>
